  <title>Quaternions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Quaternions get a bad rap. It takes just one person to yell "four dimensional imaginary numbers!", and 
    students run for their lives. Don't fall for the scare tactics - quaternions are just helpful little creatures that love to rotate things. 
    They are made by the intersection of two planes passing through the origin, giving the axis of rotation. You already know my favourite quaternion, the number 1.
