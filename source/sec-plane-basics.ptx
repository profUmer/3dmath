  <title>Plane basics</title>
  <p>
    It might be useful to start with something that is not a plane, as shown below.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="figure-not-a-plane">
    <caption>The curvature of space-time around a massive object is not a plane.</caption>
    <image source="images/curved-spacetime.jpg" width="80%" rotate="0"/>
  </figure>
<p>
  Notice how the fabric of space-time in <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-not-a-plane" /> curves around the massive object. That's
  not a plane. We need a flat sheet, like the image below:
  <!-- <figure xml:id="figure-plane-x-is-zero">
    <caption>The plane <m> x = 0 </m> </caption>
    <image source="images/plane x is zero.png" width="80%" rotate="0"/>
  </figure> -->

<figure xml:id="figure-plane-x-is-zero">
  <caption>The plane <m> x = 0 </m>. Note that I have only drawn a tiny part of the infinitely large plane.</caption>
    <image xml:id="plane-x-is-zero" width="80%">
      <asymptote>
import solids;
size(0,150);
currentprojection = orthographic(0.2,0.5,1,up=Y);
draw(scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(0.0, -0.5, -0.5) * rotate(-90, Y) * unitplane, surfacepen=lightgray,
light=nolight);
draw(-1.1X -- 1.1X,
arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$x$",
position=EndPoint));
draw(-1.1Y -- 1.1Y,
arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$y$",
position=EndPoint));
draw(-Z -- 1.1Z, arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$z$",
position=EndPoint));
      </asymptote>
    </image>
</figure>


The whole "infinitely large and infinitesimally thin" definition throws off a lot of people. It's hard to imagine something so
different to what we see in the real world. But planes are defined by simplest equations. The plane in <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-plane-x-is-zero" /> 
that stretches out forever is described by the following equation:
<md>
<mrow> x = 0 </mrow>. 
</md>
That's it! Every point on the plane has an <m> x </m> coordinate of zero. Could we have a simpler equation?
</p>

<p>
Wait, there's more! These are also plane equations:
    <md>
      <mrow>y = 0</mrow>
      <mrow>z = 0</mrow>
    </md>
and are shown visually below.
<figure xml:id="figure-planes-y-and-z-are-zero">
  <caption>The planes <m> y = 0 </m> and <m> z = 0 </m> drawn in pale green and pale blue respectively. </caption>
    <image xml:id="planes-y-and-z-are-zero" width="80%">
      <asymptote>
import solids;
size(0,150);
currentprojection = orthographic(0.2,0.5,1,up=Y);

<!-- y = 0 plane -->
draw(scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(-0.5, 0.0, -0.5) * rotate(90, X) * unitplane, surfacepen=palegreen,
light=nolight);

<!-- z = 0 plane -->
draw(scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(-0.5, -0.5, 0.0) * rotate(0, Y) * unitplane, surfacepen=paleblue,
light=nolight);

draw(-1.1X -- 1.1X, arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$x$", position=EndPoint));
draw(-1.1Y -- 1.1Y, arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$y$", position=EndPoint));
draw(-Z -- 1.1Z,    arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$z$", position=EndPoint));
      </asymptote>

We've covered the essential planes that cut through the origin and are lined up the three coordinate axes.
But what about planes that don't go through the origin? Also easy! Check out the three planes below:

<figure xml:id="figure-planes-x-away-from-origin">
  <caption>The planes <m> x = -0.5 </m>, <m> x = 0.5 </m> and <m> x = 1 </m>.</caption>
    <image xml:id="planes-x-away-from-origin" width="80%">
      <asymptote>
import solids;
size(0,150);
currentprojection = orthographic(0.2,0.5,1,up=Y);

<!-- x = -0.5 plane -->
draw(shift(-0.5, 0, 0) * scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(0.0, -0.5, -0.5) * rotate(-90, Y) * unitplane, surfacepen=lightgray,
light=nolight);

<!-- x = 0.5 plane -->
draw(shift(0.5, 0, 0) * scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(0.0, -0.5, -0.5) * rotate(-90, Y) * unitplane, surfacepen=lightgray,
light=nolight);

<!-- x = 1 plane -->
draw(shift(1, 0, 0) * scale(1.8,1.8,1.8) * shift(0.0, -0.5, -0.5) * rotate(-90, Y) * unitplane, surfacepen=lightgray,
light=nolight);

draw(-1.1X -- 1.2X, arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$x$", position=EndPoint));
draw(-1.1Y -- 1.1Y, arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$y$", position=EndPoint));
draw(-Z -- 1.1Z,    arrow=Arrow3(), L=Label("$z$", position=EndPoint));
      </asymptote>
    </image>
</figure>

The three planes above correspond to the the equations:
    <md>
      <mrow>x = -0.5</mrow>
      <mrow>x = 0.5</mrow>
      <mrow>x = 1</mrow>
    </md>
Notice the number on the right side of the equals sign above and compare it to <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-planes-x-away-from-origin" />.
Did you notice that the number corresponds to the closest distance between the plane and the origin? For example the plane <m> x = 0.5 </m> 
is <m>0.5</m> or more units away from the spot where x, y, and z are all zero. But hold on, the plane <m> x = -0.5 </m> is also
<m>0.5</m> or more units from the origin, but on the negative side of the x-axis. That might convince you that the number is actually
the "signed" minimum distance from the origin, where the <m> \pm </m> sign tells you whether the plane cuts through the positive
or negative side of the relevant axis. That means we can generalize the <m> x </m> plane equation to the following:
    <md>
      <mrow>x = d</mrow>
    </md>
where <m> d </m> is the called the signed distance to the origin.
