  <title>Plane basics</title>
  <p>
    It might be useful to start with something that is not a plane, as shown below.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="figure-not-a-plane">
    <caption>The curvature of space-time around a massive object is not a plane.</caption>
    <image source="images/curved-spacetime.jpg" width="80%" rotate="0"/>
  </figure>
<p>
  Notice how the fabric of space-time in <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-not-a-plane" /> curves around the massive object. That's
  not a plane. We need a flat sheet, like the image below:
  <figure xml:id="figure-plane-x-is-zero">
    <caption>The plane <m> x = 0 </m> </caption>
    <image source="images/plane x is zero.png" width="80%" rotate="0"/>
  </figure>

The whole "infinitely large and infinitesimally thin" definition throws off a lot of people. It's hard to imagine something so
different to what we see in the real world. But planes are defined by simplest equations. The plane in <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-plane-x-is-zero" /> is described by the equation
<m> x = 0 </m>. That's it! Every point on the plane has an <m> x </m> coordinate of zero.
