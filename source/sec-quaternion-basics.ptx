    A plane acts as a reflecting mirror, but what happens if you reflect twice? 
    It turns out you end up with a rotation, as shown in the picture below.

  <figure xml:id="figure-reflecting-in-two-planes">
    <caption>A cat reflected across two planes. The final cat has been rotated from it's original position. 
    Notice the angle between the planes is 45<degree/> but the cat has been rotated by 90<degree/>.
