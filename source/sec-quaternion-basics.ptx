    A plane acts as a reflecting mirror, but what happens if you reflect twice? 
    It turns out you end up with a rotation, as shown in the picture below.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="figure-reflecting-in-two-planes-1">
    <caption>A cat reflected across two planes. The final cat has been rotated from it's original position. 
    Notice the angle between the planes is 45<degree/> but the cat has been rotated by 90<degree/> anti-clockwise.
    </caption>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Be careful with rotations, as order matters. The following picture contains the same mirror planes as 
    the picture above, but the cat is reflected in the opposite order.
  <figure xml:id="figure-reflecting-in-two-planes-2">
    <caption>A cat reflected across two planes, but this time the order of reflections has been swapped compared to <nbsp /><xref ref="figure-reflecting-in-two-planes-1" />. 
    Notice the cat is still rotated by 90<degree/> at the end, but now it is a clockwise rotation.
