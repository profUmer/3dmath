  <title>Dual Quaternions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> I find it annoying fiddling around with 16 numbers in a big 4x4 matrix. Isn't there an easier way to rotate and translate things?
    Yes! Welcome to dual quaternions. Remember how quaternions are just lines that go through the origin. Well what if the line went through 
    something other than the origin? That's all a dual quaternion is, so no need to panic. They are created by 
    two intersecting planes (creating that line I was talking about), and are made up of 8 numbers. </p>
