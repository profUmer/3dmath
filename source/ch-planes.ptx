  <title>Planes</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> When I say "Planes", I mean an infinitely thin and flat sheet that stretches on and on forever. I know what you are thinking - 
    how can they possibly be useful for 3D graphics which is definitely not rendered on an infinitely large screen? Well, it turns
    out that planes can be combined together to make lines and points and also reflect, rotate, and move objects too. Now that's useful! </p>
